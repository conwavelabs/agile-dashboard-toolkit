# Sprint Reliability Tracker Overview

The Sprint Reliability Tracker provides comprehensive insights into your team's ability to deliver committed work, helping you understand trends in sprint predictability and commitment accuracy.

## What is Sprint Reliability?
### Definition
Sprint Reliability measures how consistently your team delivers on sprint commitments by comparing story points committed at sprint start versus story points completed by sprint end.

```
Sprint Reliability = (Completed Story Points / Committed Story Points) √ó 100%
```

### Why It Matters
- **Predictability**: Enables better sprint planning and forecasting
- **Trust**: Builds stakeholder confidence in team estimates
- **Improvement**: Identifies patterns for process optimization
- **Communication**: Provides data-driven insights for retrospectives


**Potential Causes for lower reliability**:
- Increasing external pressures
- Team capacity changes
- Growing technical debt
- Process degradation

### Sprint Retrospectives

#### Discussion Points
1. **Reliability Trends**
   - "Are we becoming more predictable?"
   - "What's driving reliability changes?"
   - "How do we compare to our goals?"

2. **Commitment Analysis**
   - "Are we over-committing consistently?"
   - "What causes incomplete work?"
   - "How accurate are our estimates?"

3. **Process Improvement**
   - "What practices improve reliability?"
   - "Where do we lose predictability?"
   - "How can we better protect sprint scope?"

## Best Practices

### Improving Reliability

#### Estimation Accuracy
```yaml
Techniques:
  - Planning poker sessions
  - Historical data reference
  - Story point calibration
  - Definition of ready compliance
```

#### Scope Protection
```yaml
Practices:
  - Sprint goal focus
  - Change request process
  - Stakeholder education
  - Emergency work protocols
```

#### Capacity Management
```yaml
Considerations:
  - Team availability tracking
  - Holiday/vacation planning
  - Meeting time allocation
  - Support work estimation
```

### Integration with Other Metrics

#### Combine with Sankey Analysis
```yaml

  - Reliability trends (commitment accuracy)
  - Sankey diagrams (scope flow patterns)
  - Velocity tracking (team capacity)
  - Sprint health indicators
```


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Data Displayed
**Potential Causes**:
- Board has no completed sprints
- Issues lack story point values
- Insufficient sprint history
- Permission access problems

**Solutions**:
- Verify sprint completion status
- Check story point field mapping
- Ensure minimum 3 sprints available
- Confirm board access permissions

#### Unrealistic Reliability Scores
**Potential Causes**:
- Incorrect story point data
- Sprint boundary issues
- Status mapping problems
- Data timing discrepancies

**Solutions**:
- Validate story point assignments
- Review sprint start/end dates
- Check issue status workflows
- Verify sprint scope tracking
